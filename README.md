# stockAnalyzer
Its not finished yet. At the end, it should create a PDF containing all the information needed about a given stock and timeframe...

yfinance is a libary, I couldn't import it so I just downloaded it and importet it directly -> temp. fix

Todo:
- Fix yfinance, at least for me
- add a requirements.txt -> basicly what you need is yfinance, talib and some other minor stuff.
- add news for the given stock -> headlines
- create good looking first PDF page
- rest pdf pages containing stock data in all intervals with different indicators
- fix some bugs and issues/ stupid code -> e.g. saving and then loading the PDF's seperatly.
